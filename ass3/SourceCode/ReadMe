RAM Mapping Problem
In this assignment, the RAM Mapping Problem is solved using Python and PuLP library.

1. Before running, make sure required libraries listed below are intalled.
    numpy -> pip3 install numpy
    PuLP -> pip3 install PuLP
    configparser -> pip install configparser

2. main.py: contain the source codes to solve the problem
   LogicRAMType.py: contain support class and functions for main.py
   ram_cofig.txt: contain RAM configurations, default is the Straix-IV configuration
   mapping.txt: mapping file generated by main.py
   mapping-passed.txt: contain the valid mapping generated by my program, the report is written based this file
   logic_block_count.txt: contain logic block count for each circuit
   logical_ram.txt: contain logical RAM information for each circuit
   checker: a legality checker

3. To run the program: python3 main.py
   mapping.txt will be generated after the program finishes
